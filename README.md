# Mission_to_Mars

This repository holds the code used in order to make web scraping in different webpages related to Mars. This was done in order to get information on this planet and gather it in a web page. The following steps were followed in order to make this happen:

1. Create code in Python in order to scrape data and store this data in a non-relational database in this case we used mongoDB.
2. Refactor the code used to make functions and automate the scraping of information
3. Create a Web page using html to diplay the data stored and give visualization to the page.

The final product after running all the processes is found below
